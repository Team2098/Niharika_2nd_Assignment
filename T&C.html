        By using a Service Offering, you agree to be bound by these terms of service (“Terms of Service”) and by the
        Service Offering Documentation, which together constitute the “Agreement”. If you do not agree to any portion of
        the Agreement, you must not use the Service Offering. Capitalized terms used in these Terms of Service are defined
        throughout these Terms of Service and in Section 12. Section references are to the provisions of these Terms of
        Service.
        The Agreement takes effect when you click “I accept” or similar button or check box presented to you as part of the
        sign-up process or when you first use the Serving Offering, whichever is earlier, and will remain in effect during the
        relevant Subscription Term or until terminated as specified in the Agreement.</h5><br>

        1. THE SERVICE OFFERING.<br><br>
        1.1 You may use the Service Offering only for your own benefit and the benefit of your affiliates. You may not
        resell or sublicense your entitlement to the Service Offering.<br><br>
        1.2 You must not use the Service Offering (a) in a way prohibited by law or that would cause you or us to be out
        of compliance with applicable law, (b) to violate the rights of others, (c) to try to gain unauthorized access to, test
        the
        vulnerability of, or disrupt the Service Offering or any other service, device, data, account, or network, (d) to
        distribute
        spam or malware, (e) in a way that could harm the Service Offering or impair anyone else’s use of it, (f) in a way
        intended to work around the Service Offering’s technical limitations, recurring fees calculation, or usage limits, or
        (g)
        for High Risk Activities.<br><br>
        1.3 You must not upload into the Service Offering any content that: (a) may create a risk of harm or loss or
        damage to any person or property; (b) may constitute or contribute to a crime or a tort; (c) includes any data that is
        illegal, unlawful, harmful, pornographic, defamatory, infringing, or invasive of personal privacy or publicity rights;
        (d)
        contains any data that you do not have a right to upload into the Service Offering; (e) constitutes information governed
        by HIPAA unless you have signed the VMware Business Associate Agreement ; or (f) is otherwise prohibited as
        specified in the Agreement.<br><br>
        1.4 If you are provided access to a Service Offering or to features or functionality of the Service Offering free of
        charge, for evaluation, trial, proof of concept, or similar purposes (an “Evaluation Service”), you must use the
        Evaluation Service appropriately in good faith for its intended purpose. Your use of the Evaluation Service is only
        permitted for 30 days (unless we specify otherwise). Use of the Evaluation Service with production data is at your
        own risk. Unless we agree, you will not have access to the Evaluation Service or to any data in the Evaluation Service
        after your authorized use period ends. The Evaluation Service is provided “AS IS” without indemnification, support,
        service level commitment, or warranty of any kind, express or implied. Our aggregate liability (excluding indirect
        damages, for which we expressly disclaim all liability) for any claim arising from your use of the Evaluation Service
        will not exceed $5,000 USD (or the equivalent in local currency).</h5><br><br>
